# Install a JSON Formatter and an API Client for Testing  

In order to support your workflow in testing the Strapi API (and by the way any API) and to better follow along with this section (and also some lessons in following sections), I recommend installing now:

- an API client, such as [Postman](https://www.postman.com/downloads/) (the most popular and the one I will be using in this section); or, alternatively, also check the [Thunder Client VsCode extension](https://www.thunderclient.com/) which should also be fine for our needs

- a browser extension for formatting JSON, such as [this one](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/json-formatter/bcjindcccaagfpapjjmafapmmgkkhgoa?hl=it) I use for Chrome

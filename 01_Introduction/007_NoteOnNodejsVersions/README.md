# Note on NodeJs versions  

As of publishing this course, Strapi supports NodeJs versions 12 to 16.

You can check which version you're running on your system by typing the following command in your terminal:

`node -v`

If you either don't have Node installed on your machine or if you have a more recent version (such as v. 17), I recommend using Node Version Manager (NVM) to install and manage one or more versions of Node on your system. It's really handy and I have a dedicated tutorial on my YouTube channel [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxJbmqRqXcg). Let me say: once you're there on my channel, I invite you to subscribe to it if you want!

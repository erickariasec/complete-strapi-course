# Note: Strapi Typescript support (beta)  

Strapi recently announced that as of version 4.2 it starts supporting (in beta) Typescript. This course doesn't use Typescript as this is not yet stable, but I strongly encourage you to experiment with it, as I am a strong believer on Typescript's ability to help in building better software and with a better dev experience.

If you do want to initialize your project with the Typescript beta option, just read [this announcement](https://strapi.io/blog/strapiconf-2022-announcements-recap) and the [beta docs](https://docs-next.strapi.io/developer-docs/latest/setup-deployment-guides/installation/cli.html#preparing-the-installation) and use that CLI command instead of the default one we'll be using in the upcoming project bootstrapping lesson.
